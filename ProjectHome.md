This extension enables querying a CMIS repository from JasperReports and filling a report with the results.  The extension includes both a JRDataSource implementation for use in Java applications that use JasperReports and JRQueryExecuter / JRFieldsProvider implementations for use in iReports.

Key features:

  * Execute a CMIS query and embed the results in JasperReports
  * Access to all cmis and custom document properties
  * Access to the content stream for select JR embeddable content types
  * FieldsProvider for easy integration with iReports

Note:  Depends on Apache Chemistry OpenCMIS and the transitive dependencies it introduces.  The latest OpenCMIS packages (with dependencies) can be downloaded from the Apache Chemistry download page:
